# AppMonitor
* FR - Supervision d'applications Web bas√©e sur Selenium Webdriver, FB Chrome Driver, RRDTool et NSCA
* EN - Monitoring for Web apps based on Selenium Webdriver, FB Chrome Driver, RRDTool et NSCA

## Features
* Define a scenario in wich you describe steps to test if a website is available, if login is successful, if different links work and get response time for each step plus total time.
* Each scenario is written in a seperate file, stored in the `testcases` folder and contains the steps to use, so you can define different steps and actions for each one.
* The TestSelenium script is lightweight and fast, so you can use it not only for unit testing, but also for monitoring your apps. That's why it's packed with RRDTool and NSCA integration.
